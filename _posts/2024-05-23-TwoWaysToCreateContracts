### Number one, creating contracts by deploy
We know mostly we can transfer from External Outside Account to 0x0 to create a new contract. The code in this transaction will be executed on Ethereum Virtual Machine. And the contract address will be logged in the state tree.

### Number two, creating contracts by invoke functions in one contract
There are also another way to create a new contract. We can use `new` keyword in a contract function to create a new contract. We can just send a transaction to the contract. And invoke the function to create a new contract.
